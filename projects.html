                        <h1>Macro Photography</h1>
                        <p >I bought my first micro lens about 10 years ago from Tokyo during a business trip. Since then, I have been experimenting with close up shots of insects, flowers and little things. </p> 
                        <p>In the spring term of 2014, I took my first course on digital photography at HES (Exposing Digital Photography). For my second project, I chose to work on comparing techniques for Macro photography.</p>
                        <p> Traditional macro photography implied using a Macro lens (In my case, it was the 60mm Micro Nikon lens). In addition, the project allowed for Do-it-Yourself macro photography. This involved reversing a regular lens and converting it into  a Macro lens.  <a href="#macro10" data-toggle="modal">Read More</a></p>

                              <p>Description: The strawberry dream picture took some time to develop the idea. Initially, I thought getting the strawberry wet taking a close up picture with water dripping would look cool, but it was not. Next, I tried dipping the strawberry in the glass full of water and take photos with high shutter speed to catch the strawberry on its way up but the exposure and lens to subject distance did not yield good photos. Finally, decided to solicit help from my mother-in-law (an avid photographer) and use my kids coloring kit and a tooth-pic and a clip to completely submerge the strawberry in water. Then simultaneously dipping paint into the water and using the remote shutter to take the photos. I also used a high lamp stand to supplement the lighting.</p>

I would encourage you to continue playing around with this technique, now that you have a handle on it to continue to find things that look interesting up close and further develop your style." </p>

The staging for that included convincing my lovely wife to spend some time putting colorful eye makeup for a closeup  shot. Used the lighting in the bathroom, the tripod and the newly acquired remote shutter control. Using Aperture Priority mode setting for this picture, I took multiple photos while varying the lighting intensity, the position of the subject, ISO and shutter speed. The best photos still had minimal light reflection but overall a very satisfactory experience. </p>

                                          <p>DIY Macro photography by reversing the lens on a digital SLR camera. Using a 72 mm Macro Reverse Ring allowed me to set it up on a Nikkor 24-120 mm zoom safely attaching to the camera and tripod for outdoor exploration. </p>
                                  
                                          <p>The Zoom is setup for manual focus and the aperture ring on the zoom is setup for maximum exposure by rotating the aperture ring on the lens. The Camera on Tripod with 24-120mm mounted in reverse focusing on decaying flower.

                                          I needed to Use the natural sun lighting for the DIY macro photo of the decaying flower. Again, used manual mode while adjusting the ISO and shutter speed and moving horizontally to gain focus. Using the reverse macro ring kept the camera stable on the tripod and allow me to focus on getting the best composition and sharpness.

                                          The camera mode is Manual with control of ISO and shutter speed for a balanced exposure while the focusing is done by moving towards or away from the subject and/or using the zoom. This picture was very rewarding after the slow the start on this project. I never noticed these tiny growing things around the yard. The photo was stunning to me.
