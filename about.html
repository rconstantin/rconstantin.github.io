                        <p class="about-us-body">Long before the digital camera and smart phone click and go, photography meant so many things to so many people. Photos captured memories, good and bad. In the old days, I carried a point and shoot film camera and few rolls of film and was very careful with my scene and shot selection. I also waited eagerly to develop my pictures and see how well I captured my subjects. With digital photography came a greater freedom of trial and error and hoping that by taking many photos, a few would be chosen and prized.</p>
                        <p class="about-us-body">My little kids turned our old iphones into cameras that they carry on their little excursions and take photos of things and creatures that interest them. They also learned very quickly to differentiate between good and bad photos and learned how to delete those photos they deem not worthy of keeping around to show their friends and teachers.</p>
